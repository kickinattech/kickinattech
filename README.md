I have been passionate about refining processes to achieve success throughout my career. My career approach has been combining strategic thinking with hands-on leadership to deliver results.

- 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on and building *proprietary source code / systems* in my current role. Hence why things are not appearing on GitHub.
- 💬 Areas that I am focused on and interested in are function building, team cultivation or process optimisation. and from a technical side cloud architecture & design, cybersecurity, SRE and platform engneering.
